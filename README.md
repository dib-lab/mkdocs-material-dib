## What is MkDocs? What is Material?

[mkdocs](http://www.mkdocs.org/) is a very straightforward 
documentation generator; it is like Sphinx, but for Markdown.

To use mkdocs, you need an `mkdocs.yml` config file
and a `docs/` directory full of Markdown files.
This will generate the site HTML in the `site/` 
directory. (This is all configurable.)

[Material Design](https://material.io/guidelines/material-design/) 
is a set of design principles originating from Google. 
This material theme will give you documentation that 
has a similar look and feel to Google documentation, 
e.g., [Google Cloud ML Engine Documentation](https://cloud.google.com/ml-engine/docs/tensorflow/getting-started-training-prediction).

[Material for Mkdocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/)
is an MkDocs theme that applies the principles of Material Design
to generate documentation that looks awesome with minimal effort.


## Quick Start

To get started, you'll follow these steps:

* Create an `mkdocs.yml` config file
* Check out the mkdocs-material-dib theme (optionally: as a submodule)
* (Optional) Set up push to deploy on Github Pages

### MkDocs Config File

Create an `mkdocs.yml` config file:

```
site_name: your-cool-site
site_url: <url-for-your-docs>
repo_name: <repo-owner>/<repo-name>
repo_url: https://github.com/<repo-owner>/<repo-name>
edit_uri: ""

# change directory names here
docs_dir: docs
site_dir: site

theme:

  # the next 2 lines are required to use the DIB version
  name: null
  custom_dir: 'mkdocs-material-dib/material'

  # pretty colors! see https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/getting-started/#primary-colors
  palette:
    primary: 'blue'
    accent: 'blue'
  
  # fun logos! see https://material.io/icons/
  logo:
    icon: 'dns'

  font:
    text: 'Roboto'
    code: 'Roboto Mono'

# this will add docs/css/custom.css to all your docs
extra_css:
  - css/custom.css


# give a title for each page
nav:
  - Index : 'index.md'
  - About : 'about.md'
  - Special Docs: 'special/docs.md'
  # etc...

# Include the following to enable disqus and
# hypothesis on your mkdocs site:
extra:
  # annotation
  hypothesis: true
  # disqus
  disqus: <insert-name-of-disqus-forum-here>
```

Note: see [mkdocs.yml in the mkdocs-material repo](https://github.com/squidfunk/mkdocs-material/blob/master/mkdocs.yml)
for a more extensive example.

### Install mkdocs

Tags v1.0 and v1.1 of mkdocs-material-dib work with mkdocs <= 0.17.

Tag v2.0 of mkdocs-material-dib works with mkdocs >= 1.0.

We recommend using mkdocs >= 1.0, which can be installed using pip:

```
pip install mkdocs>=1.0
```

### Check Out `mkdocs-material-dib` Theme

Run these commands from wherever you added `mkdocs.yml`
(probably your main repo directory).

Option 1 (no frills): clone a copy of `mkdocs-material-dib`

```
git clone https://github.com/dib-lab/mkdocs-material-dib.git
echo "mkdocs-material-dib" >> .gitignore
echo "site/" >> .gitignore
```

and commit:

```
git add .gitignore
git commit .gitignore -m 'Ignore mkdocs-material-dib'
```

Option 2 (distributable): add `mkdocs-material-dib` as a submodule

```
git submodule add https://github.com/dib-lab/mkdocs-material-dib.git
echo "site/" >> .gitignore
```

and commit:

```
git add .gitmodules .gitignore mkdocs-material-dib
git commit .gitmodules .gitignore mkdocs-material-dib -m 'Add mkdocs-material-dib submodule'
```

**NOTE:** if you have a submodule in a repo, you need to clone it
using the `--recursive` flag to also clone the contents of the 
submodule:

```
git clone --recursive <git-repo-url>
```

If you already have a copy of the repo checked out, but the submodule is empty,
initialize the submodule contents:

```
git submodule update --init
```

### Set Up Push-To-Deploy on Github Pages

The following process will make your final documentation 
available on Github Pages via the following URL:

```
https://<repo-owner>.github.io/<repo-name>
```

When we generate documentation with mkdocs, it puts the 
final static content into a directory called `site/`.

We want to make `site/` into a copy of 
our repo - specifically, the `gh-pages` branch,
which will be a completely separate branch from
the master branch. 

This is a push-to-deploy model: when we push content 
to the `gh-pages` branch, it is deployed to Github Pages.

From the root of this repository, start by removing the site 
directory if it already exists. Now clone a second copy of 
the repo to the `site/` directory:

```
git clone https://github.com/<repo-owner>/<repo-name> site/
cd site/
```

From the site directory, create an orphan branch 
called `gh-pages`. An orphan branch shares no history
with any other branches in the repo. This keeps our 
web content from mixing with our code.

```
git checkout --orphan gh-pages
```

Now remove all the files in the site directory,
and add a "Hello World" page to test that 
Github Pages is working:

```
rm -rf * .gitmodules .gitignore
echo '<h1>Hello World</h1>' > index.html
git add index.html 
git commit index.html -m 'Initial commit of gh-pages branch'
git push origin gh-pages
```

Now go to your repository settings on Github
and enable Github Pages for your repository.
Select the `gh-pages` branch for the content 
location.

Check your Github Pages URL for that hello world page:

```
https://<repo-owner>.github.io/<repo-name>
```

Once you see Hello World, you're ready to upload your docs.
Back in the main directory of your repository,
or wherever `mkdocs.yml` is located, run the command
to build your documentation with mkdocs:

```
mkdocs build
```

This will build all of your documentation 
in the `site/` directory.

To test your documentation out locally, run

```
mkdocs serve
```

and visit `localhost:8000` in your browser.

When you are happy with your documentation,
make a clean copy in preparation for uploading it:

```
rm -rf site/*   # Clean out any existing files
mkdocs build    # Build the docs in site/
cd site/
git add -A .    # Stage every change in the current directory for commit
git commit -a   # Commit all changes
git push origin gh-pages
```

Alternatively, you can use ghp-import:

1. update the docs and commit your changes to master/branch of choice
2. `mkdocs build` to update the docs
3. if you havenâ€™t already, install ghp-import: `conda install -c conda-forge ghp-import`
4. use ghp-import to push the updated to docs to the gh-pages branch  `ghp-import site -p`

Now your documentation should be live!

To re-make your documentation, just re-run the 
block of commands above.
